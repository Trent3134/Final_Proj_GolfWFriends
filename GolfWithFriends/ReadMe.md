This is a Golf App kind of like a social media. The app allows you to add a golfer to a friend. And once you add them they will automatically appear on your friends list.
There are many working peices in this project, I had to use User Identity for majority of the project, a couple foreign keys to represent that many to many relationship between 
the 2 golfers. 
here are a couple useful microsoft docs i found on the web to help me throguh some of the UserId
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/identity/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-aspnet-identity
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity
Was really challenging at first, because that was something I was unfamilar with, so It was a very good learning experience. the great thing with UserId is that you can allow the user
to create his or her own golfer right at the login screen, so once they are logged in they can get right into the app and start looking for players to play or just to rate a course.

there is also, a restriction put on the site that only users can access the site, so if you do not have an account you will not be able to use the site at all. 

There is even a course rater db in the site, that allows you to rate a recent course you played, or just a course you play a lot. All that take for you to rate it is
a first and last name, where the course is located, the rating of the overall course, and the difficulty you found the course.

One really cool thing is The one club challenge, which some golfers do for fun on hole. Spin the wheel and whatever it lands on, is the club you have to use for the entire hole.

There is also stuff i would like to add to the site over time, the main items on the site took the majority of my time, so I will go back over time and create new versions of the app.
